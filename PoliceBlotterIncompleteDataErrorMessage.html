            I scrape Pittsburgh Bureau of Police logs every morning and display criminal incidents.

            I strive to provide the best analysis of the city's data, but I'm limited to the accuracy of the contents and the number of incidents provided by the police. It is important that any decisions based on this data be confirmed using additional resources.

            As the city says, "The City of Pittsburgh has provided this information as a service. The City assumes no responsibility for the use of information posted on this site."

            Blame Tim Condello, Mark Howe, Andrew McGill, Andy Somerville and Open Pittsburgh for creating me.
